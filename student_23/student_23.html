        Hi, I'm Natalia and this first page is about a book youve probably heard of, HARRY POTTER!
   If not it's an amazing book by the author J.K.Rowling and it's a series of 8 books. it's about a wizard, "Harry Potter", who's parents
   died and he is being chased by the dark lord "Voldemort". He has friends that help him along the way, Hermione is really smart and Ron
        who is just a good friend then he finds others along the way. It's a great read!<A/>
