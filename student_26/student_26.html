Hello Im Ziggy, I am a Havanese puppy. My mommys name is Dixie Mae, and my breaders name is Tara Wills. I was born In Pensilvania,
    Now I live in California with my Family! I love to play with my toys, Ball, Bones, And espetialy my Beaver toy! 
    Although I love my toys, my Daddy took away a bunny toy that I really liked, I liked it so much that I chewed a hole threw it the
    First day I got it! Some time I can Be a little bit of truoble. Onece I bit threw a charger and it was plugged in, My mommy
    said it was bad for me to do that, and I could have gotten electracuted! I love my treats (espetially the ones with Lamb and Chicken 
    Liver). I resently got a popsicle toy that you put in the freezer. I will not play with it onless you make me think it yours!
    I love to give Kisses, but sometimes my teeth hurt and I nibble a little. My family says it Hurts, but when I bite my tail
    I dosent hurt! I just think their to sesative. Ive had lots of people coming to my house to meet me, they are very nice, 
    but I have to tell you they are all over me, Its crazy! I get it I get it Im to cute.
